# Description:
#   A GitHub issue comment notifier for hubot
#
# Configuration:
#   HUBOT_TEAM_PATH - (Optional) If you want to convert GitHub's `@` mention to another services's (Slack and etc.) mention, you can specify a json file to describe the conversion rule.
#
#   You need to add `HUBOT_URL/hubot/github-issue?room=ROOM[&only-mentioned=1]` to your repository's webhooks.
#     HUBOT_URL: Your Hubot server's url
#     ROOM` To which room you want to send notification
# 
#     When `&only-commented=1` is added, it sends notifications only when there are `@` mentions.
