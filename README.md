## Assumptions

`hubot-github-comment-notifier` makes the following assumptions:

- Pull request and issue comments should be notified with assignee and mentions when they are specified
- Pull request and issue comments may be notified in different rooms
- May limit notifications only when there are mentions in comments
  - Currently other conditions like labels and milestones are not supported to limit notifications
  - Your pull requests are welcomed to add more control to the notification limitation
- Other GitHub events than pull request and issue comment should be supported in other modules
  - Use [hubot-github-repo-event-notifier](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-github-repo-event-notifier), for example, if you need support for other events
- Only sends notifications when
  - pull request
    - pull request is (re)opened

    - issue is (re)opened
    - comment is added to issue
